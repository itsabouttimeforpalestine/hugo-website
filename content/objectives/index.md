The overarching goals of the project are made explicit below. 
Ultimately, the question boils down to a choice between justice or injustice. More precisely, whether the world supports universal rights or continues to accept that some people can dominate others:

* Justice: Palestinians self-determine like everybody else in the world.
* Injustice: Israel is allowed to finish the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank and annex it.

This project aims to accelerate this choice, that is to make the world reach the tipping point where it realizes that yes, Palestinians should self-determine; the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Israel must be stopped. 


Thus the ultimate goal is the self-determination of the Palestinians people. By this we mean that Palestinians should be offered at least the option to live in their own sovereign country.

* The question of the borders of the country are not in the scope of this project, but it can be assumed to include at least the territories of the 1967 borders recognized by the UN.
* Whether or not there are other options to choose from, such as a single state solution, likely depends on Israel. This project does not support any specific option.
* The modalities of self-determination are to be organized by the international community. Again, not in the scope of this project.

The above goal can be reached if the following conditions are satisfied:

* the international community agrees that Palestinians have a right to self-determine. 
* the international community enforces the right of the Palestinian people to self-determine .[^1]  


Technically there are two ways this can happen: either Israel also accepts that Palestinians have a right to self-determine, or the international community acts against the will of Israel. Naturally the first option is vastly preferable. This project encourages any non-violent action likely to make Israel support self-determination (even if reluctantly).

Israel does not currently support the self-determination of the Palestinian people and is unlikely to support it without significant pressure from the international community. Thus the essential goal of this project is to bring the international community to put pressure on Israel until it accepts the right of Palestinians to self-determine.

* Rationale: Israel prevents the application of a fundamental right and shows no intention to abide by international laws and recommendations. The country de facto annexes territories and implements ethnic cleansing, in complete violation of multiple international laws. This behaviour has been going on for a very long time and the multiple warnings given by the international community have been ignored. For all these reasons, we claim that Israel should be regarded as a "rogue state", in the sense that the country acts like a criminal organization: Israel is acting against the greater good and using violence to achieve its own goals, thus feeding the cycle of injustice and threatening peace for everyone.
* The pressure of the international community is intended to coerce Israel through peaceful means, such as diplomatic, economic, cultural and scientific sanctions.  


In order to bring the international community to sanction Israel, this project aims to initiate a grassroots movement in the countries which still support Israel, which consist essentially of the Western world. 
 In every target country, the movement aims to make political leaders clearly state their support for international sanctions against Israel. As a symbolic gesture, target countries are also encouraged to recognize the state of Palestine to mark their support for the Palestinian people.


This project will design and progressively implement a roadmap towards this goal. The strategy consists essentially in making it clear that countries have a choice to make and pressuring target leaders and political organizations into publicly acknowledging their position.[^2] As the project will emphasize that this is a simple matter of justice for Palestinians, it is assumed that most political leaders in democratic countries cannot afford to support injustice publicly.[^3] Thus this project is entirely focused on establishing pathways towards this objective, with as much detail and flexibility as possible.





[^1]: One may note that if the international community agrees but does not act to enforce their decision, then the goal is not reached.

[^2]: One may note these two points go strongly against the status quo. Western political leaders prefer not to make any public choice on this topic, considering that the issue is too complex and does not depend on them.

[^3]: This strategy may look naive. This is to some extent intended, as the project aims to deconstruct the apparent complexity of the issue. In particular, the choices of the West with respect to Israel should be questioned from the perspective of 21st century morality.
