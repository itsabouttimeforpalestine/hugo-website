*Martin Luther King*

The emergence of Zionism can be understood as a reaction to both rampant antisemitism and the colonialist atmosphere, both lively in Europe in the 19th century. Thus it is born out of two forms of illegitimate violence: violence against Jewish people, and violence against indigenous people in the colonies. Unsurprisingly, Zionism follows the traditional false assumption that using violence is the solution to perceived weakness. The emancipation of Jews is seen as an empowerment from the perceived status of weak victims towards strong and dominant people. The fact that this requires making another group of people victim of this domination does not feel wrong to Zionists, because this is consistent with the vision of the world where one is either dominant or dominated.[^1] 

The Holocaust was the culmination of antisemitism in Europe. The West was chilled by its own evil, but of course didn't admit any collective guilt and pretended that there was a clear line between the Nazis and the Allies. The flirtatious relations that many of the "good guys" had with fascism or Nazism before and even during WW2 were quietly forgotten. But the "good guys" had to deal with the difficult question of the [displaced people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_persons_camps_in_post%E2%80%93World_War_II_Europe), in particular Jewish Holocaust survivors who feared going back home to a place where their former antisemitic neighbours stole their property and were certainly unwelcoming. At the end of WW2, justice was not served for most victims and most criminals. In this context, given that Zionism was also [alive and kicking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing) in Palestine, Holocaust survivors were not asking for justice (which was unlikely to happen anyway), they were asking for their own country in order to defend themselves. This was an understandable request, but also the propagation of violence to a different place and different people. And it was similarly understandable that Palestinians and Arabs reacted with violence to the violence brought on them.[^2]

This is the tragic story of how the West exported its antisemitism: unable and unwilling to apply justice in Europe, the West chose to dump the cycle of violence somewhere else by accepting the creation of Israel instead. This way, the Muslim world became largely antisemitic by reaction... and the West pretends to be horrified. Naturally Israeli people were feeling threatened (once again for many of them), so a lot of them developed and nurtured their own culture of hatred towards Palestinians... and the West pretends to be horrified. On both sides, hatred brought the most extremist people to power, who encourage total dehumanization of the other side. Unsurprisingly, horrible massacres follow... and the West pretends to be horrified. The West plays the moral high ground and tries to [strike a balance](../the-fallacy-of-neutrality/) while supposedly keeping their hands clean of all the savagery... In fact, the West has a lot to answer for.

From a psychology point of view, the story of Israel is a textbook example of repeatedly refusing to address a traumatic issue, instead compensating with violence, causing more pain and suffering which in turn produce an ever increasing level of violence and trauma.[^3] The humiliation of Germany after WW1 leading to Hitler, the Holocaust leading to the creation of Israel, powerless Arabs being robbed of their hope of the end of colonization, Israel carrying out ethnic cleansing "to defend itself", and the endless cycle of massacres as a tragic game of tit for tat. There is a mountain of unprocessed trauma, and a lot of people on both sides are still at the stage of denial, just hoping that the other side will disappear. The West is carrying the original guilt of both antisemitism and colonization, and neither were properly acknowledged. The level of collective trauma caused by the Holocaust is massive, yet many survivors were not offered justice; instead they were given weapons to bring violence on somebody else, reproducing the pattern like so many victims of domestic abuse. 

Of course, this collective psycho-ish interpretation simplifies a lot of history, individual behaviour and singular events. But the noticeable pattern for anybody who brings a sincere and caring look at all this mess is this: truth is rarely admitted; mistakes and faults are not acknowledged; grief is poorly processed or not at all; reconciliation is barely even considered; and naturally, forgiving is unconscionable for the vast majority of victims. The anger and thirst for revenge reach alarming levels in the population, resulting in a complete lack of empathy which is a typical symptom of the most severe psychological conditions.

The West caused and maintained this horrible mess. It was not on purpose, but it definitely has a huge responsibility in this. First, in the 21st century, the mistakes of the past should be finally acknowledged, and there are a lot of them. The West eventually rejected slavery, it recognized the Holocaust, and there was some (moderate) recognition of the fault of colonization, but it didn't even start to acknowledge the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. The faults of the past have been done and cannot be undone, but the first thing that victims are due is the decency of the world recognizing their trauma. If the Western world is sincere in championing of a non-violent world order, it should own up to its mistakes and finally try to fix them, instead of fueling the hatred as it does so far. 

Children should not be blamed for the mistakes of their parents. In fact, nobody should be blamed; instead, everything should be done to help every individual heal from the hatred. Israel, as a country, is guilty of causing serious harm for which it should eventually pay reparations, in the same way as [victims of the Holocaust received compensation](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/may/18/a-jewish-case-for-palestinian-refugee-return). However the state of Israel should not be conflated with Israeli individuals (even those who are in the IDF), and Hamas should not be conflated with Palestinian individuals (even those who are Hamas fighters). Any victim whose feelings and pain are not acknowledged is bound to reproduce the abuse. Virtually all the individuals in this conflict should be treated as victims of collective abuse over multiple generations. It's time to outgrow the habit of violence and use words instead.

[^1]: Zionism has many things in common with fascism. Jabotinsky, an important figure of Revisionist Zionism, saw [fascist ideas positively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism#Jabotinsky's_position_towards_Fascism). 

[^2]: Jabotinsky was perfectly honest about it: *"We cannot offer any adequate compensation to the Palestinian Arabs in return for Palestine. And therefore, there is no likelihood of any voluntary agreement being reached. So that all those who regard such an agreement as a condition sine qua non for Zionism may as well say "non" and withdraw from Zionism. Zionist colonisation must either stop, or else proceed regardless of the native population. Which means that it can proceed and develop only under the protection of a power that is independent of the native population - behind an iron wall, which the native population cannot breach. That is our Arab policy; not what it should be, but what it actually is, whether we admit it or not."*

[^3]: Netanyahu's policy of pure military and technological domination over Palestinians can  be seen as another clear example of the failure of violence to solve anything. Sadly, a lot of people interpret this as insufficient strength, i.e. not enough violence. Psychologists know this very well: there can never be enough violence to solve the problem, simply because violence is not the solution to the problem.
 
[^4]: The concept of ethnic religion is itself questionable, in the sense that
[ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity) is a largely subjective notion related to individuals' identity.

[^5]: *"In the 1880s, when the first colonies were formed, Jews made up only 3 or 4 percent of the inhabitants of what would become Palestine. Most of them were Biblical scholars funded from abroad."* [[source]](https://newrepublic.com/article/177306/israel-colonialist-state-history-today)
