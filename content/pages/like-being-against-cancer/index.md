The communication campaign should addresses the ignorance and hesitancy that many people feel regarding Palestine and Israel. Paradoxically, most people are ignorant about the issue despite having some basic, vague understanding about it. People who are not politicized tend to see this particular conflict as a terrible mess, with a complex history and a very sensitive religious aspect. It is not only by indifference that these people don't have any public opinion about it: first, the apparent complexity makes them feel that they don't know enough to form an opinion; second, the religiousness is a huge red "danger" sign, because people are acutely aware that any opinion about the topic is going to be interpreted either as antisemitism or racism/Islamophobia. Naturally Netanyahu's Israel conflates anti-Zionism and antisemitism to shame regular people into not criticizing Israel, so the fear of being labeled as antisemitic is especially strong in the Western world [^1]. For all these reasons, people who have no link to the conflict think that the wise choice is not to have any opinion, a choice seen as neutral (TODO link). This is a very understandable choice, so our goal is to overcome the above obstacles to make regular individuals care for Palestine. 

Overcoming the reluctance that people feel w.r.t the conflict requires tackling all the levels of representation: historical accuracy is needed, in particular because some of the narratives that Israel has pushed for decades (e.g. the Nakba being mostly voluntary) have been quite successful. So there needs to be a sustained effort to explain what really happened and counter disinformation. However this process is largely already done, in the sense that information is available to people who want it. The problem being that most people do not want it, an important awareness campaign should be raised (and not only through the usual progressive media).

But beyond the "intellectual" audience, we must also deliver a very simple level of representation to the vast majority of people who simply don't care. They are not bad not to care, they just feel that they don't have time, they have other worries, they are not smart enough, etc. The goal should be to make them understand and support the Palestinian cause simply because it's right: it's justice, it's a free country, it's what good people want.

The childish "good guys vs. bad guys" representation is relevant here, because most people, especially on the conservative side, see themselves as good people. Typically they feel that they are against racism, injustice, oppression, bullies, etc. Thus a crucial goal of the project is to give Palestinian self-determination the public image of something to fight for, a good cause which is deprived of its legitimate freedom by an unfair and violent bully. It should become as easy to side with Palestinians as it was to oppose the Afrikaner Apartheid, because there is a side for justice and a side for injustice. The project should push for a wide cultural change on this topic, even by pushing for cultural events like popular songs or movies.[^2] 

It should become as obvious to support Palestinian self-determination as being against cancer, really. This comparison is not a joke: cancer is a disease which attacks regular people meaninglessly, it's unfair; Netanyahu's Israel does pretty much the same. 


[^1]: As a matter of fact, racism and/or Islamophobia are much better tolerated. See TODO.

[^2]: For instance, the movie "Lethal Weapon 2" (1989) was a big-audience action movie which dresses the bad guys as apartheid Afrikaners. And of course, there have been countless movies of all kind of size and quality where the bad guys are Nazis. It is universally accepted in the Western world that injustice imposed by force by some intolerant racist ideology makes for some easy-to-hate bad guys.
