summary: "Culturally Israel is a Western country, since it is organized closely like a Western country, with similar democratic institutions, in particular a similar legal system. They have a good education system, they have brilliant lawyers, lawmakers, politicians who are trained to debate and analyze the subtleties of the law. Also, they tend to look serious in the same way as Westerners, wearing a suit and a tie, talking in a smart and articulate way."

Culturally Israel is a Western country, since it is organized closely like a Western country, with similar democratic institutions, in particular a similar legal system. They have a good education system, they have brilliant lawyers, lawmakers, politicians who are trained to debate and analyze the subtleties of the law. Also, they tend to look serious in the same way as Westerners, wearing a suit and a tie, talking in a smart and articulate way.

Israel always had an advantage in defending its position with Western countries. They speak the language in every way: not only they can speak a perfect English but they belong to the same social and cultural classes as their Westerner counterparts. This is how systemic racism works: the victim is not rudely excluded, but subtly less listened to than the one who belongs to the club, who knows how to woo the audience.


Even if one assumes no racism (a bold assumption), on the contrary Palestinians and other Arab states probably often gave an impression of anger, hostility and stubbornness. They started wars on Israel with the explicit goal to destroy the country, showing themselves as uncontrollable bad guys. Of course this was not lost on Israel, and naturally the version that Israel presents is the one where they are the good guys, patient, reasonable, open-minded, vs. Palestinians seen as savages, brutal, ignorant. 

So Israel could be perceived as the reasonable party, the "adult in the room" and the victim of crazy "terrorists". In this way, Israel benefited from a crucial bias in its favor: it was essentially given the responsibility to deal with the issue as they see fit. This is a major negligence of the Western countries which let this happen: they made Israel, one of the belligerent parties, judge of the conflict. Israel has been allowed to take any measure they see as necessary, from occupation to imprisonment and of course acts of war. No oversight, and the communication that Israel gives is almost always taken for granted. 

It is so evidently unfair that Israel is given veto power by Western countries on the creation of the state of Palestine, under the logic that Israel cannot accept the birth of a state willing to destroy Israel in its backyard. It's as if nobody noticed that Israel is well on its way to destroy even the idea of Palestine! 

Western countries are willfully ignoring the fact that Israel, as a side of the conflict, cannot be left in charge of solving the conflict. The West has been blinded by its own prejudice in favor of Israel, and naturally Israel exploited this (who wouldn't?). The current disastrous situation is the direct result of this negligence.
