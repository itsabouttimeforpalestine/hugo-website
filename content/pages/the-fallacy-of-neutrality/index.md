summary: "A common attitude by Western politicians is to choose 'not to take any side'. By this they mean that they do not want to choose a side between Israel and Palestine, they see careful neutrality as the moderate and reasonable option. They might even see this option as a way towards peace, a call to calm addressed to both sides. "

A common attitude by Western politicians is to choose "not to take any side". By this they mean that they do not want to choose a side between Israel and Palestine, they see careful neutrality as the moderate and reasonable option. They might even see this option as a way towards peace, a call to calm addressed to both sides. 

This is hypocritical, since the status quo clearly benefits Israel, which is far more powerful. Thus this position is not neutral, even though it is intended to give an impression of balance or even justice. In terms of political image, it shows calm, seriousness and peace.

It is absolutely necessary to replace this narrative with language which reflects the true nature of the status quo: as a third party, adopting the so-called neutral position clearly favors Israel, the abuser, to the expense of the victim, Palestine. This is a a denial of justice comparable to neutrality in a case of domestic violence: if a man beats his wife, the right thing is to intervene in order to protect the woman; telling both to calm down and to accept the other is taking side for the abuser.
